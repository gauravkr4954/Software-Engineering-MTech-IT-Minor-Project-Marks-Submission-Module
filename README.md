- **Backend-Side Pagination**: Added to make API endpoints efficient, reducing the load and improving performance for large datasets.  
- **Search and Sort**: Implemented wherever necessary, allowing for quick data retrieval and better usability.  


## Setup Instructions

1. Open a terminal in the main folder of the project.

2. Install virtualenv:

   ```
   sudo apt install virtualenv
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```
   virtualenv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run database migrations:

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Start Celery Server
   ```
   celery -A it303 worker --loglevel=debug
   ```
8. Start the server:

   ```
   gunicorn --workers 3 it303.wsgi:application
   ```

8. Create a JSON file with your Google Sheets API credentials and save it in the `mtechMinorEval/static` directory.

## Creating a Superuser

To access the admin panel, create a superuser:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up your superuser account.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the home folder of the project and add your credentials according to the `.env.example` file:

```
EMAIL = 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS'
PASSWD = 'GOOGLE_SMTP_API_PASSWORD'
TWILIO_SID = 'TWILIO_SID_TOKEN'
TWILIO_AUTHTOKEN= 'TWILIO_AUTHTOKEN'
TWILIO_MESSAGE_SERVICE_SID='TWILIO_MESSAGE_SERVICE_SID'
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY='SITE_KEY'
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY='SECRET_KEY'
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

## Google Sheets API Credentials

Create a Desktop application in Google Sheet API dashboard. Download a JSON file containing your Google Sheets API credentials and save it in the `mtechMinorEval/static` directory with the name `client.json` . This file is necessary for the application to interact with Google Sheets.

## Twilio

Create a [messaging service](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/services) in twilio console. Use that messaging service to [send an sms to personal number](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/try-it-out/send-an-sms). Copy all credentials and paste in .env file.

## Running the Application

After completing the setup and configuration steps, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to the address provided by the development server (typically http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
